## Abstract
In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of four different machine learning models: Linear Regression (including Ridge and Lasso regression), Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict heart disease using a dataset combining a total of 920 instances and 75 attributes. We discuss the data preprocessing steps, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation to provide a comprehensive understanding of each model's efficacy in predicting heart disease. After training and testing the different models, we compare our approach to the approaches of other authors who worked with this dataset.
